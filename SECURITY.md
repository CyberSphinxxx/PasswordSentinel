# Security Policy for PasswordSentinel

## Security Disclaimer

PasswordSentinel is a demonstration project intended for educational purposes. While I do my best to implement secure practices, users should be aware that this is not intended to be a primary password management solution. For sensitive data, please use established, professionally audited password managers.

## Known Limitations

- Passwords are stored in browser local storage without encryption
- Password generation uses JavaScript's Math.random()
- No master password protection
- Client-side only security implementation
