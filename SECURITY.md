# Security Policy for PasswordSentinel

## Security Disclaimer

PasswordSentinel is a demonstration project intended for educational purposes. While I do my best to implement modern security practices including AES-GCM encryption, users should be aware that this is not intended to be a primary password management solution. For sensitive data, please use established, professionally audited password managers.

## Current Security Features

- ✅ AES-GCM 256-bit encryption for stored passwords
- ✅ Secure key generation using Web Crypto API
- ✅ Protected local storage with encryption
- ✅ Secure error handling for cryptographic operations
- ✅ Modern password strength evaluation

## Known Limitations

- Encryption key stored in browser local storage
- No master password protection yet
- Client-side only security implementation
- Password generation uses Web Crypto API but could be further strengthened
- No automatic session timeout

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within PasswordSentinel, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.
2. Send details of the vulnerability to johnlemargonzales@gmail.com
3. Include the following information:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

### What to expect:

- Acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours
- Regular updates on the progress of addressing the vulnerability
- Credit for responsible disclosure (if desired)

## Response Timeline

- **24-48 hours:** Initial acknowledgment of report
- **1 week:** Assessment of vulnerability
- **2-4 weeks:** Implementation of fix (depending on severity)
- **Post-fix:** Public disclosure and credit (if appropriate)

## Security Best Practices

When using PasswordSentinel, please follow these security guidelines:

1. Do not use this tool for storing highly sensitive passwords
2. Regularly clear your browser's local storage
3. Use a secure, up-to-date browser
4. Be cautious when using on public or shared computers
5. Enable your browser's security features
6. Keep your operating system and browser updated
